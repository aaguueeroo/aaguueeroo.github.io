## Initial Setup

### Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and npm. If you're setting up on a fresh macOS installation, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Homebrew (Package Manager)

If Homebrew isn't installed, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, add Homebrew to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Verify installation:
```bash
brew --version
```

#### 2. Install Node.js

Install Node.js via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

Verify installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

#### 3. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Notion API Setup

This project uses Notion as a CMS for blog posts. You'll need to set up Notion API access:

### Step 1: Get Your Notion API Key

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Or navigate: Notion → Settings & members → Connections → Develop or manage integrations → New integration

2. Create a new integration:
   - Click "+ New integration"
   - Name it (e.g., "Blog Website Integration")
   - Select your workspace
   - Click "Submit"

3. Copy the API key:
   - On the integration page, find "Internal Integration Token"
   - Click "Show" and copy the token (starts with `secret_`)
   - This is your `NOTION_API_KEY`

### Step 2: Get Your Database IDs

You need two database IDs: **Blog Database** and **Categories Database**.

#### Method 1: From the Database URL (Easiest)

1. Open your Blog database in Notion
2. Click the "..." menu (top right) → "Copy link"
3. The URL looks like:
   ```
   https://www.notion.so/YourWorkspace/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?v=...
   ```
4. The database ID is the 32-character hex string (with or without dashes)
   - Example: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6` or `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`

5. Repeat for your Categories database

#### Method 2: Extract from URL

The database ID is the long string of characters in the URL path. You can copy it directly from the URL.

### Step 3: Share Databases with Your Integration

1. Open your Blog database in Notion
2. Click "..." (top right) → "Connections"
3. Find your integration and connect it
4. Repeat for your Categories database

### Step 4: Create Your .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Edit the file and add your credentials:

```
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_BLOG_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_CATEGORIES_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored and should not be committed to version control.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Fetch Blog Posts from Notion

To fetch and update blog posts from Notion:

```bash
npm run fetch-blog
```

This script will:
- Fetch all published blog posts from your Notion database
- Download cover images and content images locally
- Generate JSON files in `src/blog/content/`
- Create an index file for blog listings

See [scripts/notion/README.md](scripts/notion/README.md) for more details about the blog fetch script.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build process automatically runs `fetch-blog` before building, so your blog content is always up-to-date.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  blog/
    content/          # Blog post JSON files (generated by fetch-blog)
    components/       # Blog-related React components
    services/         # Blog service utilities
    types/            # TypeScript types for blog data
  components/         # Reusable UI components
  pages/              # Page components
  theme/              # Theme configuration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables

If you see errors about missing environment variables:
- Ensure your `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify all three required variables are set:
  - `NOTION_API_KEY`
  - `NOTION_BLOG_DATABASE_ID`
  - `NOTION_CATEGORIES_DATABASE_ID`

### Notion API Errors

- Verify your API key starts with `secret_`
- Ensure database IDs are correct (32 characters)
- Check that both databases are shared with your integration
- Verify the integration has the correct permissions

### Blog Fetch Issues

See [scripts/notion/README.md](scripts/notion/README.md) for detailed troubleshooting information.
